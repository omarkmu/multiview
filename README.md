# Multiview

Multiview is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that provides utilities for creating dynamic,
interactive page content with JavaScript. It achieves this by allowing creation of views (content states)
and providing utilities for creating HTML content and embeds.

This plugin is currently in development, and is not yet documented at all.
If you'd like to test it, you can run `npm i` and `npm run build`, then place the `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json`
files in a new subfolder within the `plugins` subfolder of your obsidian config directory (`.obsidian` by default).

### Current Features

- View creation and navigation system
- JavaScript module system
- HTML element creation utilities
- Embed creation utilities (PDF, YouTube, media)
